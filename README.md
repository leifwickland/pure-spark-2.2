# Pureconfig/Spark 2.2.x sample project

This project demonstrates that pureconfig can be used to load configuration for a Spark 2.2 application submitted in either `--deploy-mode client` or `--deploy-mode cluster`

## Motivation

Running in `--deploy-mode client` allow more flexibility in how to load the config files because you know which local file system your driver will see. However, `--deploy-mode cluster` has the huge benefit of not making the box from which jobs are submitted the bottlenecks.

The only methods I've found which reliably allows configuration to be loaded in **both** `cluster` and `client` `--deploy-mode` are:
- Wrap the configuration files into a separate `.jar` and include it in the classpath of the driver via the `--jars` switch to `spark-submit`. This seems to be the least bad of the options.
- Use a devops tool like puppet, ansible, or chef to ensure the example same config file is deployed at the same path on all boxes that the driver could run on. Generally the devops folks I've worked with have not favored this approach.
- Pass `-Dkey=value` switches to `spark-submit` via `--conf "spark.driver.extraJavaOptions=-Dkey1=value1 -Dkey2=value2"`. This has disadvantage of requiring all configuration to appear in the command line. Not only is that cumbersome, but also exposes any potentially sensitive information such as passwords to anyone with shell access to the box `spark-submit` was invoked on.
- Include the configuration files into the assembly `.jar`. This has the disadvantage of requiring a change be made to the `.jar` to adapt to each envirnonment in which it runs. 

If you only need to support `--deploy-mode client` then you have more options:
- Tell pureconfig to load a local file explicitly. For example your `main()` could take an argument for the config file path which was then passed to `pureconfig.loadConfigFromFiles()`.
- Include your config file directory in the classpath via the `--driver-class-path` switch to `spark-submit`. Note that you should pass the directory containing the files, not the path to the files per se.

## Creating a config `.jar`

Use the `zip` command to create a `.jar` file containing config files. Yes, a `.jar` is just a `.zip`. For example you'd do something like this for the sample `pure-spark.conf` in this project.

```
cd src/test/resources/
zip ../../../pure-spark.config.jar pure-spark.conf
```

**NOTE:** you almost certainly want the `.conf` file at the root of the `.jar`. By default `zip` includes any path to files in the `.jar`. Consequetly you most likely want to be in the same directory as the `.conf` file when you create the `.jar`.

**NOTE:** I prefer to use a file name other than `application.conf` for my config file because other `.jar` files can insert those into the classpath. For example, Pepperdata's libraries stomped all over my `application.conf`. Thus the basis of using an alternative name like `pure-spark.conf`

## Trying out this project

This project loads `pure-spark.conf` via pureconfig and prints its content to stdout and a file in the path specified by the first CLI argument.

1. `sbt assembly`
2. Create the config `.jar` as described above.
3. Copy the resulting `pure-spark-2.2.0-assembly.jar` and `pure-spark.conf.jar` to your cluster
4. Run the job in client mode. You may need to adapt this line depending on whether you have a YARN cluster and whether `spark-submit` is in your path.
```
spark-submit \
  --deploy-mode client \
  --master yarn \
  --class example.PureSpark \
  --jars pure-spark.conf.jar \
  pure-spark-2.2.0-assembly.jar /tmp/pure-spark/conf
```
5. Stdout and `cat /tmp/pure-spark/conf*/*` should both display something like:
```
Started
Success(AppConf(DbConf(jim,MASKED,place,time)))
```
6. Run the job in cluster mode. You may need to adapt this line depending on whether you have a YARN cluster and whether `spark-submit` is in your path. You'll also need some sort of shared file system path for the logged results to be written to.
```
spark-submit \
  --deploy-mode cluster \
  --master yarn \
  --class example.PureSpark \
  --jars pure-spark.conf.jar \
  pure-spark-2.2.0-assembly.jar <shared file system path>
```
7. View the output on `<shared file system path>`

## Shading

Note that it's **not** required to shade the shapeless classes. ["Shading"](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/a/351091/124277) includes a JAR in the assembly after renaming the package all of its classes and the references to those classes, so that the dependency doesn't conflict with one loaded early in the classpath by the framework (spark) executing the assembly. 

Pureconfig depends on the same version shapeless than is included in Spark 2.2.
